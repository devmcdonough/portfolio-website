                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>ScreenRanker is a first of its kind marketplace for intellectual property that can be adapted
                        into film or TV.</p>

                    <h3>Role</h3>
                    <p>I worked as the lead UX/UI designer and project manager.</p>

                    <h3>Key Objective</h3>
                    <p>Screenranker is going to be the first ecommerce marketplace for Intellectual Property. This
                        includes the sale of rights or ownership to any of the following: Books, Podcasts, Stage Plays,
                        Documentaries, Video Games, Merchandise and Journalism.

                        The organization’s goal is to have a fully responsive website released by the end of Q4 in 2023.

                        The product suite must include responsive designs for their onboarding flow, home page, search
                        results page and a product page displaying the individual IP. </p>

                    <h3>Market Research Findings</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The market for IP has recently undergone a radical shift. While in previous decades the
                            buyers for IP were generally limited to the major studios that number has gone up
                            dramatically with the proliferation of streaming services, production companies and smaller
                            independent studios.
                        </li>
                        <li>While more movies are not necessarily getting made, the amount of IP being purchased or
                            optioned has increased dramatically.
                        </li>
                        <li>Adapted IP is increasing in popularity, proven to be a better/safer ROI for producers, and
                            there is yet to be a robust ecommerce solution that helps facilitate sale and search of this
                            type of content.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Blacklist, which is a website where screenwriters pay to post their original scripts
                            online, has become enormously successful. This is despite the finding that most original
                            scripts are a far less valuable commodity than known IP. Producers see IP as content with a
                            built-in market while making a film based on an original film is far more of a gamble.
                        </li>
                        <li>On the seller side, we found that creators ultimate goals are to have their work adapted.
                            Very few books or other content make very much money but if their work can be adapted they
                            are paid from that and given more exposure.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As of now there is no central location for selling intellectual property. Publisher’s
                            Marketplace seems to be the most popular but advertising IP is mostly decentralized among
                            social media and scattered marketplaces.
                        </li>
                        <li>Most sites for advertising IP are medium specific and books are the only type of medium with
                            any existing infrastructure. Meaning booksellers advertise in one place, other artists
                            mostly tend to advertise their work through social media. While books have historically been
                            the main source of stories for film and TV recently podcasts, video games and other types
                            have launched successful franchises.
                        </li>
                        <li>Existing marketing sites are not tailored to how people in the film industry search for IP
                            to adapt. They do not have sophisticated search features that would allow for buyers to
                            search for themes, or types of roles for actors to play. We found in our research with
                            industry types that these are the most important factors in how they look for IP to adapt.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Personas</h3>
                    <div class="mb-4">
                        <img src="img/UX_Persona.png" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Persona">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Using the information we gathered from our surveys and user interviews we created personas of
                        our most likely buyers and sellers of IP. They are used exclusively using quotes from the
                        interviews or surveys. The persona types were created based on matrices of profession and
                        status. We were focused on recruiting “Hard users” so we wanted be able to identify the needs of
                        high level creators and entertainment industry professionals but also mid-tier users as well. We
                        created personas for high and mid-tier producers, screenwriters and actors as well as
                        best-selling authors and published authors who had not written a best seller.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We created wireframes to help us test concepts and conduct usability testing before moving on to
                        the visual design.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                        We conducted three rounds of usability testing focusing on the onboarding process which is the
                        most complex part of the site. The initial areas where users had difficulty getting through the
                        flow was mainly on the Plot/Theme page with our design for picking multiple genres and tags to
                        add to their work. In the first round only one participant out of five was able to easily
                        complete the task while three had some difficulty and one could not complete it. After some
                        redesign and several more rounds of testing we had a session where four out of five participants
                        were able to get through it easily and one completed it with some difficulty.
                    </p>
